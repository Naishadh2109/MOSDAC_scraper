# MOSDAC_scraper
A Web Scraper specifically for the MOSDAC website that gives the output in json format.

Here, I worled on scraping particular sections of the MOSDAC website such as the Catalogs menu which contained 3 items:
1. Satellites
2. In-situ
3. RADAR

Each of the above items led to their own page having two drop down menus each:
1. Satellites
2. Sensor

Combination of above two for each item gave a table containing various information such as Product Description, Processing Level, Temporal Resolution etc.
